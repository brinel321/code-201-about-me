    <h1>My Background</h1>
    <p>I am a highly dedicated, self driven, and passionate project management professional. Throughout my career I have always led by example, upheld a high moral standard, and I firmly believe in leading through empowerment. I live each day and complete every task with the same high level of energy, commitment, and attention to detail. I strive to deliver consistent excellence and build credibility through being a consistent servant leader.  I am looking to combine my leadership skills, knowledge of managing teams, and education to continue as a project or program manager within the technology, civil construction, or medical sectors.</p>
